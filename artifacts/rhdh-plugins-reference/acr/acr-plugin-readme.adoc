= Azure Container Registry

The Azure Container Registry (ACR) plugin displays information about your container images available in the Azure Container Registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Azure Container Registry plugin is a Technology Preview feature only.

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend using them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].

Additional detail on how Red Hat provides support for bundled community dynamic plugins is available on the https://access.redhat.com/policy/developerhub-support-policy[Red Hat Developer Support Policy] page.

The Red Hat Plug-ins for Backstage (RHPIB) packages are hosted in a separate NPM registry, which is maintained by Red Hat. To use these packages, you must adjust your NPM configuration to pull the `@redhat` scoped packages:

[source,subs="+attributes"]
----
# update your .npmrc or .yarnrc file
yarn config set "@redhat:registry" https://npm.registry.redhat.com
# then pull a package 
yarn add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----

For more information, see link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc[npm docs]. 

Creating a `.npmrc` file ensures that all the packages are scoped under `@redhat` and are fetched from link:https://npm.registry.redhat.com/[Red Hat's NPM registry], while the rest dependencies remain sourced from other link:registry.npmjs.org[registry].

.Procedure

. Run the following command to install the ACR plugin:
+
--
[source,subs="+attributes"]
----
yarn workspace app add @redhat/backstage-plugin-acr
----
--
endif::[]

. Set the proxy to the desired ACR server in the `app-config.yaml` file as follows:
+
--
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
   # app-config.yaml
   proxy:
     '/acr/api':
       target: 'https://mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/acr/v1/'
       changeOrigin: true
       headers:
         # If you use Bearer Token for authorization, please replace the 'Basic' with 'Bearer' in the following line.
         Authorization: 'Basic ${ACR_AUTH_TOKEN}'
       # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted artifactory instance with a self-signed certificate
       secure: true
----
--

. Set the authorization using one of the following options:
+
--
* Basic authorization:
** Navigate to the ACR portal and go to the *Access Keys* tab.
** Retrieve the username and password of the Admin user and use the https://www.debugbear.com/basic-auth-header-generator[Basic Auth Header Generator tool] or run `echo printf '<username>:<password>' | base64` in a terminal to convert the credentials to a basic token.
** Set the generated token as `ACR_AUTH_TOKEN` in environment variables.

* OAuth2: 

** Generate bearer access token using the process described in Authenticate with an Azure Container Registry.
+
You can generate a bearer token using your basic authorization token, for example:
+
[source,curl,subs="+attributes"]
----
curl --location 'https://<yourregistry>.azurecr.io/oauth2/token?scope=repository%3A*%3A*&service=<yourregistry>.azurecr.io' \ --header 'Authorization: Basic <basic_token>'
----

** Set the generated token as `ACR_AUTH_TOKEN` in environment variables. Also ensure that you replace the `Basic` with `Bearer` in the `app-config.yaml` file. 
--

. Enable an additional tab on the entity view page using the `packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx` file as follows:
+
--
[source,subs="+attributes"]
----
/* highlight-add-start */
import { AcrPage, isAcrAvailable } from '@redhat/backstage-plugin-acr';

/* highlight-add-end */

const serviceEntityPage = (
  <EntityPageLayout>
    // ...
    {/* highlight-add-start */}
    <EntityLayout.Route path="/acr" title="ACR">
      <Grid container spacing={3} alignItems="stretch">
        <EntitySwitch>
          <EntitySwitch.Case if={e => Boolean(isAcrAvailable(e))}>
            <Grid item sm={12}>
              <AcrPage />
            </Grid>
          </EntitySwitch.Case>
        </EntitySwitch>
      </Grid>
    </EntityLayout.Route>
    {/* highlight-add-end */}
  </EntityPageLayout>
);
----
--

. Annotate your entity using the following annotations:
+
--
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
metadata:
    annotations:
        'azure-container-registry/repository-name': `<REPOSITORY-NAME>',
----
--

== For users

=== Using the ACR plugin in {product-short}

ACR is a front-end plugin that enables you to view information about the container images from your Azure Container Registry in {product-short}.

.Prerequisites
