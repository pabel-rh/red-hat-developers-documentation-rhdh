== Change in sign-in resolver configuration location

Previously, configuring the sign-in resolver to bypass user provisioning in the {product-short} software catalog required setting `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog: true` at the root of the `{my-app-config-file}` file.

In this release, the previous root level configuration has been moved to the resolver level. For more details, see link:{authentication-book-url}[{authentication-book-title}].

[id="breaking-change-rhidp-5568"]
== The `dynamicPlugins.cache.volumeClaimSpec` field is removed from the Helm Chart, dynamic plugin storage is now ephemeral

The `dynamicPlugins.cache.volumeClaimSpec` field has been removed from `values.yaml`, making all dynamic plugin storage ephemeral by default. Instead of the Helm chart managing persistent volume claim (PVC) creation, you must now manually configure ephemeral volume claims under `extraVolumes`.

This change also resolves issues with running multi-replica {product-very-short} deployments, as using a PVC for the Dynamic Plugins cache previously led to potential write conflicts.
