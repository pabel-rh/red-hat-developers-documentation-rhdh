[id="deprecated-functionality-rhidp-6013"]
== Deprecation of legacy dynamic plugin configurations and export options

Due to ongoing improvements in dynamic plugin functionality, the following features are deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* `apiFactories` configuration: Dynamic plugins must now define API factories directly within their plugin using the `createPlugin` API for better integration and maintainability.

* `export-dynamic-plugin --embed-as-code` and `--no-embed-as-dependencies`: These options, which inline each dependency as code, have been deprecated because plugins exported this way cannot properly access the database. The `--embed-as-dependencies` option, now the default for package `export-dynamic-plugin`, replaces this behavior.
