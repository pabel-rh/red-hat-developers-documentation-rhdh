=== Fixed incorrect username display in Profile drop-down

Resolved an issue where the *Profile* drop-down in the global header displayed *Guest* instead of the logged-in user's name when using OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication. The drop-down now correctly shows the user's display name by checking `spec.profile.displayName`, then `metadata.title`, and falling back to the name shown on the *Profile* card in the *Settings* page if neither is available.

=== Fixed favicon not reflecting custom branding configuration

In versions 1.5.0 and 1.5.1, the `app.branding.iconLogo` value in the `app-config` was not applied as the browser favicon. This issue has been resolved in 1.5.2, and the configured branding icon now correctly appears as the favicon.

=== Report issue feature and oversized icon in TechDocs

Previously, the *Report a documentation issue* feature in TechDocs was not functional. Additionally, selecting text in a TechDoc displayed an oversized icon instead of the intended tooltip button.

This issue has been fixed, ensuring that users can now select content and report issues correctly using the tooltip button.

=== Keycloak access token lifespan and refresh performance

When using {rhbk} as an OIDC provider, the default access token lifespan was set to five minutes, causing frequent refresh token requests as the token neared expiration. This resulted in performance issues due to the frequent token refreshes.

To resolve this, you can increase the access token lifespan on the Keycloak server by adjusting the *Access Token Lifespan* setting under *Configure -> Realm Settings* to a value greater than five minutes. This adjustment prevents unnecessary refresh token calls and improves performance.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-5609"]
=== Improved OCI artifact handling and prevented unintended deletion

This update introduces a new `pullPolicy` configuration to enhance support for floating tags in OCI artifacts. The `pullPolicy` setting provides more consistent behavior across platforms handling image containers and offers two options:

* `Always`: Compares the image digest in the remote registry and downloads the artifact if it has changed, even if the plugin was previously downloaded.
* `IfNotPresent`: Downloads the artifact only if it is not already present in the dynamic-plugins-root folder, without checking image digests.

The `pullPolicy` setting is also applied to the NPM downloading method, though `Always` will download the remote artifact without a digest check. While the existing `forceDownload` option remains functional, `pullPolicy` takes precedence, and `forceDownload` might be deprecated in a future release.

Additionally, this update fixes an issue where OCI artifacts were unintentionally deleted during the clean up phase if only the URL was modified.

=== Corrected enabled status display for external plugins

Previously, plugins installed from external sources were incorrectly displayed with a *No* in the *Enabled* column on the *Plugins* page. This update fixes the UI logic to ensure that externally installed plugins now correctly appear with a *Yes* in the *Enabled* column as expected.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-5573"]
=== Dynamic plugins PVC now ephemeral by default to prevent upgrade issues
In {product-short} Helm Chart version 1.4.2+, it was possible to configure the storage class and access mode for the dynamic plugins persistent volume claim (PVC) using the `dynamicPlugins.cache.volumeClaimSpec` field in the Helm values file.

In version {product-version}, this behavior has been reverted, making the dynamic plugins root PVC ephemeral by default. This change addresses issues encountered when upgrading the Helm Chart or running multiple replicas of {product-short}.

You can still customize the ephemeral volume claim’s storage class and access mode using the `upstream.backstage.extraVolumes` field, as shown in the following example:

.Example configuration
[source,yaml]
----
upstream:
  backstage:
    extraVolumes:
      - name: dynamic-plugins-root
        ephemeral:
          volumeClaimTemplate:
            spec:
              accessModes:
                # TODO: Change the access mode below
                - ReadWriteOnce
              resources:
                requests:
                  storage: 5Gi
              # TODO: Add your storage class below
              storageClassName: "<my-custom-storage-class>"

      - name: dynamic-plugins
        configMap:
          defaultMode: 420
          name: '{{ printf "%s-dynamic-plugins" .Release.Name }}'
          optional: true

      - name: dynamic-plugins-npmrc
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          optional: true
          secretName: '{{ printf "%s-dynamic-plugins-npmrc" .Release.Name }}'

      - name: dynamic-plugins-registry-auth
        secret:
          defaultMode: 416
          optional: true
          secretName: '{{ printf "%s-dynamic-plugins-registry-auth" .Release.Name }}'

      - name: npmcacache
        emptyDir: {}

      - name: temp
        emptyDir: {}

However, ensure that all link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-chart/blob/release-1.5/charts/backstage/values.yaml#L145-L181[other volumes] declared in the default Helm Chart are also included.

=== Support for multiple replicas across cluster nodes

Previously, the {product-short} Helm Chart did not support running multiple replicas on different cluster nodes due to the automatic creation of a dynamic plugins root persistent volume claim (PVC). This issue has been resolved by reverting the PVC creation and switching to an ephemeral volume by default, allowing multiple replicas to function properly.

=== Configurable image and disable option for `test-connection` pod

In previous versions of the {product-short} Helm Chart, the image for the `test-connection` pod could not be configured, which posed challenges for air-gapped environments. The `test-connection` pod is created when running helm test to validate a deployed release.

This issue has been resolved by introducing configuration options to specify the image and allowing the `test-connection` pod to be disabled entirely. The following fields are now available in the Helm Chart:

.Example configuration fields in Helm Chart
[source,yaml]
----
# -- Test pod parameters
test:
  # -- Whether to enable the test-connection pod used for testing the Release using `helm test`.
  enabled: true

  image:
    # -- Test connection pod image registry
    registry: quay.io

    # -- Test connection pod image repository. Note that the image needs to have both the `sh` and `curl` binaries in it.
    repository: curl/curl

    # -- Test connection pod image tag. Note that the image needs to have both the `sh` and `curl` binaries in it.
    tag: latest

=== `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error in GitLab org catalog and Notification backend plugin

Previously, the GitLab org catalog backend plugin and Notification backend plugin failed to load when configured, displaying a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error. This issue has been fixed by embedding the missing dependencies within the GitLab org catalog backend dynamic plugin, ensuring proper functionality.

=== Monorepo detection in `package-dynamic-plugins` CLI command

The `janus-idp` CLI command `package-dynamic-plugins` is designed to work with both monorepos and single plugin projects. This update resolves a bug in the tool’s monorepo detection, which previously caused the tool to fail with the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'packages')` when run in a single plugin project.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-5014"]
=== Improved dependency resolution for embedded packages in CLI

Previously, the CLI examined the dependencies of embedded packages during the export process by calling require from the monorepo root. This could lead to incorrect dependency resolution, especially when wrapping an existing plugin.

With this update, the CLI now calls require from the embedded package's parent directory, ensuring that the most relevant dependencies are correctly identified and used.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-4828"]
=== Improved CLI handling for dynamic plugin export

Previously, the CLI required each dynamic plugin project to define an `export-dynamic` script for the `package-dynamic-plugin` command to successfully export the plugin.

With this update, defining an `export-dynamic` script is no longer necessary. The `package-dynamic-plugin` command now automatically attempts to run the `export-dynamic-plugin` command with default arguments, simplifying the export process.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-6180"]
=== Improved startup performance for RBAC backend plugin

Previously, the startup process would slow down when handling a large number of CSV entries due to roles and permission policies being added individually. In this release, roles and policies are now added in bulk, improving the startup speed of the RBAC backend plugin.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-4697"]
=== RBAC performance for large user and group counts

Previously, organizations with a large number of users and groups experienced slower response times due to RBAC permission evaluations. This update includes performance improvements to help mitigate those slowdowns.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-6088"]
=== Expanded support for conditional aliases

Previously, conditional aliases were only functional for the catalog conditional rule of `IS_ENTITY_OWNER`. With this update, aliases now apply to all rules, improving flexibility and functionality.

[id="bug-fix-rhidp-4696"]
=== Rolling update issue with PVCs

Previously, upgrading an existing {product-short} Helm release using rolling updates was blocked due to the automatic creation of a dynamic plugins root persistent volume claim (PVC) with a hardcoded `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. This prevented new replicas from being scheduled on different nodes.

This issue is now resolved by reverting the PVC creation and using an ephemeral volume by default, enabling rolling updates and allowing multiple replicas to function as expected.

=== Air-gapped installation script for ROSA clusters

Previously, the installation script for the Operator failed to run on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters in air-gapped environments. This issue has now been resolved, ensuring the script functions correctly on ROSA.
